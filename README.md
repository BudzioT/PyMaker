# PyMaker
## :computer: Info
PyMaker, a Platformer with editor's elements like Mario Maker.<br><br>
It is written in Python with PyGame as the main engine and deployed with pyinstaller<br>
It is an platformer, where you can first build your level and then play it! Try to make some hardcore ones.<br>
(Watch out when jumping on objects that deal damage, you will probably lose a lot of health).


## :hammer: How to build the project
You can use the app without building by going into <b>dist/main</b> and using .exe generated by pyinstaller!<br>
If you want to build it yourself:
- Download PyGame
- Compile the main.py file, compiling other without it doesn't result in anything
